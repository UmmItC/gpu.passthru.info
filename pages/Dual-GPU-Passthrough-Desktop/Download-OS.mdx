## Downloading the Operating System

This section cover how to download both Windows 10/11 and the Virtio ISO.

Keep in mind that Windows 11 has some additional requirements, like TPM (Trusted Platform Module), which makes its setup a bit different.

Don’t worry, I’ll guide you through every step, so just follow along.

### Visit the Website to Download the ISO

You can find the Windows ISO files on Microsoft’s official website, should be simple lol.

For a more tailored approach, here are a couple of recommended sources:

#### Revision

The Revision website offers Windows ISO files and provides a playbook for debloating Windows. Although I won’t go into the debloating process here, you can download the ISO from:

[Revision - Windows ISO Downloads](https://revi.cc/docs/playbook/installwindows#downloading-the-windows-iso)

#### AtlasOS

AtlasOS is another excellent option, especially if you’re interested in debloating Windows 10/11. Again, I won’t cover the debloating process here, but you can download the ISO from:

[AtlasOS - Download ISO](https://docs.atlasos.net/getting-started/installation/#1-download-an-iso)

### Downloading the Virtio ISO

For better performance with virtual machines, you'll need the Virtio drivers. Download the latest or stable Virtio ISO from the official GitHub repository:

1. Visit the [Virtio Win GitHub page](https://github.com/virtio-win/virtio-win-pkg-scripts/blob/master/README.md).
2. Download the stable or latest ISO from the provided links in the repository.

### Fastest Way to Download

Downloading via a standard browser can be slow because it uses a single thread. To speed up the process, I recommend using `aria2`, a tool that supports multi-threaded downloads. Here’s how to use it:

1. Install `aria2` with `pacman`:
   ```shell
   sudo pacman -S aria2
   ```

2. Copy the download link from the website or use your browser’s network monitor (press F12) to grab the URL.

3. Use `aria2` to download the ISO with multiple threads:
   ```shell
   aria2c -x 16 "paste-your-download-link-here"
   ```

## Next Steps

The guide will be split into different sections for Windows 10, Windows 11, and GNU/Linux.

- **For Windows 10:** Follow the instructions in the Windows 10 section.
- **For Windows 11:** Refer to the Windows 11 section.

Each section will provide detailed steps for installing the respective operating system. The GNU/Linux installation is straightforward and does not require any additional steps beyond the basics.
