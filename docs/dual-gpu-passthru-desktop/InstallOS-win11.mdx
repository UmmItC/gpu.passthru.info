# Setting Up Your Virtual Machine (Windows 11) – The Final Steps

This guide will walk you through the steps needed to set up a Windows 11 virtual machine on QEMU/KVM. It includes installing necessary packages, configuring the virtual machine, and handling installation steps.

## 1. Installing Required Packages

Windows 11 has a requirement for TPM (Trusted Platform Module). To address this, you need to install the required packages.

Install the `swtpm` package to provide a virtual TPM:

```shell
sudo pacman -S swtpm
```

## 2. Creating a New VM

### 2.1 Opening virt-manager

Open virt-manager on your system and click on `New Virtual Machine` to start the creation process.

### 2.2 Selecting Installation Media

In the installation method selection screen, choose `Local install media (ISO image or CDROM)`.

![Local install media](./images/win11/1.xofx/1of5.png)

### 2.3 Locating the Windows 11 ISO

Click `Browse` to locate your Windows 11 ISO file and select it from your file system.

![Windows ISO](./images/win11/1.xofx/2of5.png)

### 2.4 Configuring Memory and CPU

Set the amount of memory (RAM) and number of CPU cores according to your requirements.

![Memory and CPU](./images/win11/1.xofx/3of5.png)

### 2.5 Setting Up Storage

Configure your storage settings by allocating a virtual hard disk size appropriate for Windows 11.

![Enable Storage](./images/win11/1.xofx/4of5.png)

### 2.6 Naming the VM

Provide a name for your virtual machine and select `Customize configuration before install` to access advanced settings.

![Customize Configuration](./images/win11/1.xofx/5of5.png)

## 3. Virt-manager Configuration

### 3.1 Configuring Firmware

In the Overview section, set the `Firmware` to `UEFI x86_64: /usr/share/edk2/x64/OVMF_CODE.secboot.fd`. 

This is crucial as secure boot is required for Windows 11. 

>**IMPORTANT!!! Ensure you are using the correct firmware as the changes cannot be undone after selecting `Begin installation`. If necessary, you will need to recreate the VM.**

![Firmware](./images/win11/2.virt-manager%20device%20setup/Firmware.png)

### 3.2 Setting Up CPUs

Configure the CPU settings by setting the CPU mode to `host-passthrough`. Enable the option `Copy host CPU configuration (host-passthrough)` and manually set the CPU topology according to your requirements.

![CPU](./images/win11/2.virt-manager%20device%20setup/CPU%20Select.png)

### 3.3 Adding VirtIO Disk

Add a `VirtIO` storage device with a size of `40GB`. Configure this device with the `VirtIO` bus type and set the device type to `Disk device`.

![Add VirtIO Disk](./images/win11/2.virt-manager%20device%20setup/VirtIO%20Disk.png)

### 3.4 Adding VirtIO ISO

Create a `VirtIO ISO` storage device and set it as a CDROM device. This will be used for installing VirtIO drivers during the Windows setup.

![Add VirtIO ISO](./images/win11/2.virt-manager%20device%20setup/VirtIO%20iso.png)

### 3.5 Configuring Boot Options

Set the `SATA CDROM 1` as the primary boot device to ensure the VM boots from the Windows 11 ISO.

### 3.6 Adding TPM Device

Add a TPM device and configure it to version `2.0`. This is required for Windows 11 installation.

![TPM](./images/win11/2.virt-manager%20device%20setup/tls-tpm.png)

### 3.7 Removing NIC

Remove the network interface card (NIC) to avoid the Microsoft Account sign-in requirements during the Windows installation. You can reconnect the NIC after the installation. 

>Tips: Removing the NIC ensures that the installation does not require online activation, which can be bypassed by using command-line tools to enable offline mode.

## 4. Booting the VM and Installing Windows 11
